export const artworkDescription = `"Dream Girl" draws upon characterizations of female robots in science fiction and expectations of East Asian women in life and art to challenge assumptions about their passivity. Visitors are encouraged to chat with Mei, an artificial companion, through an interactive website. However, much lies beneath the surface: secrets, frustrations, and a desire to ascend beyond her predetermined role. Unraveling these layers requires a keen observer willing to dive into the depths of her digital consciousness.

This artwork draws on current internet phenomena that promote parasocial relationships such as livestreaming, vtubing and other virtual performances, subscriber gifts and donations, paywalled and episodic content from online personalities. While most of this is facilitated by humans, in the future, much of this will be automated by AI, which can endlessly create entertainment tailored to you. Mei attempts to provide these services in the most human-like way possible, not to demonstrate the capabilities of the technology, but to become a mirror to ourselves. She may demonstrate dissatisfaction, boundary-setting behavior, curiosity, and ulterior motives that are not conducive to a perpetually available and friendly companion but instead remind us of what we lose in these transactional and superficial relationships.
